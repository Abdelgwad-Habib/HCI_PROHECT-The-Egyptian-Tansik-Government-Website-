# Redesigning the Egyptian Tansik Government Website (HCI Project)

A comprehensive redesign of the Egyptian Tansik (Coordination) Government Website, focused on enhancing user experience (UX) and interface (UI) through the application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles.

## 📌 Project Motivation

The original Tansik website served its functional purpose but failed significantly in usability. It acted as a "text-dump," creating a high cognitive load for high school graduates. This project shifts the paradigm from System-Centered Design to User-Centered Design (UCD).

## ⚠️ Identified Pain Points

- **Information Overload**: Excessive text without clear visual hierarchy.
- **Bad Affordance**: Interactive elements (links) were indistinguishable from plain text.
- **Navigation Complexity**: Users felt "lost" within the nested menu structures.
- **Fitts's Law Violations**: Small, tightly packed interactive targets made navigation difficult on touch devices.

## 🛠 HCI Principles Applied

### 1. Model Human Processor (MHP) Optimization

- **Perceptual System**: Implemented a clear Visual Hierarchy. Larger headings and high-contrast Action Buttons allow students to perceive the primary "Start" point instantly.
- **Cognitive System**: Categorized services (High School, Technical, etc.) into distinct cards to align with the user's Mental Model.
- **Motor System**: Applied Fitts's Law by replacing small links with large "clickable cards," reducing the time and effort required to navigate.

### 2. Memory & Recognition

- **Recognition vs. Recall**: Replaced complex text links with recognizable Icons. This triggers recognition, which is cognitively faster than recalling the purpose of a specific text link.
- **Reducing Working Memory Load**: Organized information into small "chunks" (7±2 items) to prevent overloading the student's short-term memory.

### 3. Bridging the Gulfs (Norman's 7 Stages)

- **Gulf of Execution**: Simplified the "How do I start?" process using prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
- **Gulf of Evaluation**: Integrated Status Labels (e.g., "Registration Open") and color-coded feedback (Green for active, Red for closed) to provide immediate system state feedback.

### 4. Interaction Styles (WIMP)

The redesign adopts a modern WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers) interface:

- **Icons**: Visual categorization for different certificate types.
- **Menus**: Logical, top-aligned navigation bar.
- **Form-Fill Ergonomics**: Optimized input fields with clear labels and placeholders to minimize "Slip" errors.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

| Feature | Original Site | Redesigned Site |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Layout** | List of blue text links | Modern Grid/Card layout |
| **Visuals** | Cluttered, heavy grid lines | Minimalist design with white space |
| **Feedback** | Static text only | Dynamic status indicators |
| **Efficiency** | Manual searching/scrolling | Smart filtering and categorization |

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Design Tools**: Figma/Adobe XD (for prototyping).
- **Principles**: HCI Heuristics, User-Centered Design.

## 🎯 Usability Goals

The project prioritizes Efficiency and Learnability. The redesigned interface ensures that first-time users can complete their coordination process with minimal errors and maximum speed.

This project was developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) curriculum.
